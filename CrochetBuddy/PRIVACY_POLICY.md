# Crochet Buddy Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 8, 2025**

## Overview

Crochet Buddy ("we", "our", or "the app") is a crochet pattern generation app designed for children and families. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable privacy laws including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored on Your Device Only

- **Pattern Data**: Crochet patterns you create are stored locally on your device
- **Progress Data**: Your stars, achievements, and completed steps
- **Pro Status**: Whether you have purchased the Pro upgrade

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- Names or usernames
- Email addresses
- Passwords
- Location data
- Personal information of any kind

## How the App Works

### Pattern Generation (AI-Powered)

When you create a crochet pattern, your text description is sent to our server, which forwards it to the Anthropic Claude API for processing. The AI generates a pattern based on your description and returns it to the app.

- Text descriptions are sent to Anthropic's API via our secure server
- Descriptions are not stored on our server after the request completes
- Anthropic's data handling is governed by their privacy policy: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

### Image Upload (Pro Feature Only)

If you use the Pro image upload feature, your image is:

- Sent to our secure server, which forwards it to the Anthropic Claude API
- Used solely to generate a crochet pattern inspired by the image
- **Not stored** on our servers after the request completes
- Processed by Anthropic under their data handling policies

We recommend parental supervision when children use the image upload feature.

## Third-Party Services
